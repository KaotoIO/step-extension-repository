== OpenAPI and Capabilities

=== Usage

Both the Capabilities document and an OpenAPI document can be used to describe the operations and resources provided by a Service or API. In most cases they fill the same role in the Publish-Find-Bind pattern. However, OpenAPI documents have uses which go beyond descriptive metadata.

One of the precepts of API development is that you first design and document your API. OpenAPI is one of the ways an API design can be documented. This has led to a suite of tools which use the OpenAPI document as a design specification. These tools attempt to automate the generation of source code based on the design documented in the OpenAPI document. Some of them actually work.

So we have to look at OpenAPI as a form of Interface Description Language (IDL). As with older IDLs (DCE, DCOM, CORBA, etc.) client developers can be expected to harvest the OpenAPI document and auto-generate client code from it. API developers must take care that the OpenAPI documents they publish are complete and comprehensive enough that an auto-generated client will work.

If we view OpenAPI as an IDL, then the capabilities (OpenAPI) document is no longer an afterthought to be thrown together once everything else is done. Rather, it becomes a statement of the design itself.

=== Information Mapping

The WFS 2.0 Capabilities document has five major sections:

* Service Identification,
* Service Provider,
* Operations Metadata,
* Feature Types, and
* Filter Capabilities.

Most of this information is also available from an OpenAPI (OAS) document. This Section will describe how the information from each of the sections of the WFS 2.0 Capability document could be supported through an OAS document.

==== Root

Both the Capabilities and OAS document provide basic data to assist clients in understanding the scope of the document. A mapping of that information is provided in Table 1.

.Root Level Information
[width="100%",options="header,footer"]
|====================
|Capabilities Path  |OpenAPI Path  |Comments
|WFS_Capabilities|OAS|This is the root of our paths
|WFS_Capabilities/@version|OAS/openapi|Indicates the version of WFS or OpenAPI that that was used for this service/API
|WFS_Capabilities/@updateSequence|OAS/info/version|Indicates the version of this Capabilities/OAS document.
|====================

==== Service Identification

A Capabilities document describes a service while an OpenAPI document describes an API. This is a crucial distinction. APIs resist organization into a taxonomy. As a result, the service-oriented fields in the SerivceIdentification element cannot be populated in a meaningful way. So we find that the ServiceType, ServiceTypeVersion, and Profile elements do not have OpenAPI equivalents. The Service Identification mappings are provided in Table 2.

.Service Identification Mapping

|====================
|Capabilities Path  |OpenAPI Path  |Comments
|WFS_Capabilities/ServiceIdentification|NA |
|  ./ServiceIdentification/Title|OAS/info/title |
|  ./ServiceIdentification/Abstract|OAS/info/description |
|  ./ServiceIdentification/Keywords|NA |OAS tags may be used for this purpose
|  ./ServiceIdentification/ServiceType|NA |
|  ./ServiceIdentification/ServiceTypeVersion|NA |
|  ./ServiceIdentification/Profile|NA |
|  ./ServiceIdentification/Fees|OAS/info/termsOfService |OpenAPI doesn't define what a terms of service document looks like, but if there are fees associated with this API, this is where they would be documented.
|  ./ServiceIdentification/AccessConstraints|Security Requirement and License Objects|Discussed below
|====================

*Access Constraints* is one area where OpenAPI comes out ahead. The Capabilities document provides an XML string element with little guidance on how to use it.  In an OAS document, applicable licenses are identified by name and made available to the client though a URL. OAS is also capable of providing detailed information about the Authentication and Access Controls which govern the API. OpenAPI security support is discussed in detail in section 10 Information Assurance.

==== Service Provider

Both the Capabilities document and OpenAPI provide information about the Points of Contact for this service/API as well as information on how to contact them. Of the two, the Capabilities document is the more complete. However, the relevant OAS objects are extensible which allows additional information to be provided if needed.

The Service Provider information mapping is provided in Table 3.

|Capabilities Path  |OpenAPI Path  |Comments
|WFS_Capabilities/ServiceProvider|NA |Service Provider root
|  ./ServiceProvider|OAS/info/contact |See discussion below
|  ./ServiceProvider/ProviderName|NA |
|  ./ServiceProvider/ProviderSite|OAS/servers/url |WFS assumes a single server while an API can expose many.  There may be more than one OAS Server Object.  In addition, the url may be a URL template describing multiple servers.
|  ./ServiceProvider/ServiceContact|  |
|====================

Contact information is one area where the Capabilities document outshines OAS. Table 4 contains the Contact Information mapping. Many of the elements in the Capabilities document can only be supported by an OAS document extension.

|  ./ServiceContact/contactInfo/ContactInstructions|extension|
|====================

==== Operations Metadata

WFS 2.0 relies on the standard to define the request response pairs. OpenAPI does not assume a governing standard. Therefore, all of the information you need to generate a request or process a response is included in the OAS document.

Capabilities documents provide two levels of metadata. Operations Metadata provides information which is applicable to all operations. Operation (singular) Metadata describes a single operation.

OpenAPI is resource oriented. So it starts with the path to the resource to be manipulated. The Path Item Objects provide information that applies to all operations against this resource. In particular, servers where the resource may be hosted, and parameters which can be used to manipulate the resource.

Path Item Objects also include Operation Objects corresponding to one or more of the HTTP verbs. Operation Objects provide the detailed information required to build an HTTP request and to process the expected returns.

Operations metadata are mapped against OpenAPI in Table 5. Operation metadata is mapped in Table 6.

==== Feature Types

WFS 2.0 advertises the types of features exposed by that service. An API specifies resource types by Path and Operation. So a WFS 3.0 may expose many Feature Types, each on its' own set of Paths. Furthermore, resources exposed by an API are not required to be of a standard format. Therefore, it is not enough for an OpenAPI document to identify the output format, it needs to be able to describe the output format.

This is arguably the one area where WFS 2.0 and 3.0 are radically different as evidenced in Table 7.

.Feature Type Mapping
[width="100%",options="header,footer"]
|====================
|Capabilities Path|OpenAPI Path|Comments
|WFS_Capabilities/FeatureTypeList/FeatureType|Response Object |Root
|  ./FeatureType/Name|Key|If the Response Object is defined in the Components Object, then it has a key associated with it so it can be referenced.
|  ./FeatureType/Title|None|
|  ./FeatureType/Abstract|ResponseObject/description|
|  ./FeatureType/Keywords|None |
|  ./FeatureType/DefaultCRS|None |
|  ./FeatureType/OutputFormats|ResponseObject/content/MediaTypeObject |Each MediaType Object has an associate key
|  ./FeatureType/WGS84BoundingBox|None |
|  ./FeatureType/MetadataUrl|None |
|====================

The Mediatype Object is responsible for providing a complete description of the response. It has two fields for this purpose, the schema field and the encoding field.

The Schema field and associated Schema Object describe the logical structure of the response. OpenAPI uses a modified version of JSON Schema in the Schema Object. However, this has been extended to also support "Alternative Schema". Alternative Schema allow one or more external definitions of the schema to be used instead of the OAS schema. For example, a GML response can be described by referencing the XML Schema and Schematron rules as alternative schema for that response.

The Encoding field and associated Encoding Object describes how the response is encoded. The most important field in the Encoding Object is the ContentType field. This is a text field which should be populated with IANA media type for the encoding used.

By specifying both the logical structure (schema) and the encoding of the response, OpenAPI can fully describe a response even if this particular resource has never existed before.

==== Filter Capabilities

The WFS 3.0 Core does not address Filter capabilities. Therefore we cannot map them into an OAS representation. This task will be addressed once the complex feature handling extensions are complete.
