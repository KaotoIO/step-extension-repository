[big]*i.     Abstract*

The WFS 3.0 standards are simple, concise, and easy to implement. To achieve this simplicity, the standards assume that implementers are well versed in OGC, spatial principles, REST, OpenAPI, and a host of other issues. That assumption is not always valid. This WFS 3.0 User's Guide provides a place to document that foundation knowledge. It also captures additional information which may prove useful to implementers. By capturing this information in a separate document, implementers have ready access to knowledge which may prove useful without cluttering up the standards themselves with non-normative information. It also allows for easy update of this knowledge without impacting the standards themselves.
