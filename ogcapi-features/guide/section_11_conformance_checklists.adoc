    * [ ] (recommended) http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-1/1.0/conf/html
    * [ ] (recommended) http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-1/1.0/conf/geojson
    * [ ] (recommended) http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-1/1.0/conf/oas30

**7.5** [HTTP 1.1](https://rawcdn.githack.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/3.0.0-draft.1/docs/17-069.html#_http_1_1)
* [ ] Conforms to [HTTP 1.1](https://rawcdn.githack.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/3.0.0-draft.1/docs/17-069.html#rfc2616), including correct use of [status codes](https://rawcdn.githack.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/3.0.0-draft.1/docs/17-069.html#http_status_codes), headers, etc.
* [ ] Conforms to [HTTP over TLS](https://rawcdn.githack.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/3.0.0-draft.1/docs/17-069.html#rfc2818), if HTTPS is used
* [ ] (recommended) Supports [entity tags](https://rawcdn.githack.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/3.0.0-draft.1/docs/17-069.html#rfc2616)

**7.7** [Support for cross-origin requests](https://rawcdn.githack.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/3.0.0-draft.1/docs/17-069.html#cross_origin)
* [ ] (recommended) If the server will be accessed from the browser, allow cross-origin requests.

**7.8** [Encodings](https://rawcdn.githack.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/3.0.0-draft.1/docs/17-069.html#_encodings_2)
* [ ] (recommended) HTML5
* [ ] (recommended) GeoJSON
* See [Media Types](https://rawcdn.githack.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/3.0.0-draft.1/docs/17-069.html#mediatypes) for guidance
* For multiple encodings, the server needs a mechanism to mint encoding-specific links, such as /my/url.geojson or /my/url?f=geojson

**7.9** [Coordinate reference systems](https://rawcdn.githack.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/3.0.0-draft.1/docs/17-069.html#_coordinate_reference_systems)
* [ ] Geometries are served in WGS84 longitude/latitude unless another is requested (similar to EPSG/SRID 4326, but with axis order longitude/latitude).
* There is currently no mechanism to request another CRS.

**7.10** [Link headers](https://rawcdn.githack.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/3.0.0-draft.1/docs/17-069.html#_link_headers)
* [ ] (recommended) All links in response payloads are included as Link headers as well.

**7.11** [Feature collection**s** metadata](https://rawcdn.githack.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/3.0.0-draft.1/docs/17-069.html#_feature_collections_metadata)
* [ ] GET request at **/collections** served
* [ ] Response content based on [collections.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/master/core/openapi/schemas/collections.yaml)
* [ ] Response "links" property includes:
  * [ ] rel "self"
  * [ ] rel "alternate" for each additional encoding available
  * [ ] (recommended) For each external link defining structure or semantics of data contained in collections, include a link w/ rel "describedby"
* [ ] Response "collections" property includes an entry for each feature collection.
  * [ ] For each supported encoding include a link w/ rel "items" to the feature collection
  * [ ] If response provides an "extent" property it is formatted as a bounding box of the form [SWlong, SWlat, NElong, NElat] for the spatial and [begin, end] for the temporal extent
* [ ] All links include "rel"
* [ ] All links include "type" specifying content type

**7.12** [Feature collection metadata](https://rawcdn.githack.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/3.0.0-draft.1/docs/17-069.html#_feature_collection_metadata)
* [ ] GET request at **/collections/{collectionId}** served
* [ ] Response is metadata for the collection indicated using the same schema as in 7.11.

**7.13** [Feature collections](https://rawcdn.githack.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/3.0.0-draft.1/docs/17-069.html#_feature_collections)
* [ ] GET request at **/collections/{collectionId}/items** served
  * [ ] "limit" query parameter indicating max number of features to provide at once.
    * [ ] "limit" parameter includes "minimum" with value 1
    * [ ] "limit" parameter includes (changeable) "default"
    * [ ] "limit" parameter includes (changeable) "maximum"
  * [ ] "bbox" query parameter.  Only features intersecting this rectangle are returned.
  * [ ] "datetime" query parameter.  Only features intersecting this time stamp or interval are returned.
  * [ ] (recommended) For simple int/string properties of features include a querystring parameter with the property name to filter on.  For strings, wildcard matches may be useful in addition to simple equality.
* [ ] Response includes links:
  * [ ] rel "self"
  * [ ] rel "alternate", one for every other content type
  * [ ] (recommended) rel "next" for additional features beyond limit.
    * [ ] "next" link uses same rules for "limit"
  * [ ] (optional) rel "prev" to mirror functionality of "next"
  * [ ] all links include "ref" & "type"
* [ ] Response includes metadata, if it not too complex to compute:
  * [ ] timeStamp as the time stamp of the response
  * [ ] numberMatched set to the number of features matching the query
  * [ ] numberReturned set to the number of features in this response (page)

**7.14** [Feature](https://rawcdn.githack.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features/3.0.0-draft.1/docs/17-069.html#_feature_2)
* [ ] GET request at **/collections/{collectionId}/items/{featureId}** served
* [ ] Response payload contains the feature identified.
* [ ] Response includes links:
  * [ ] rel "self"
  * [ ] rel "alternate" for other content types supported.
  * [ ] rel "collection"
