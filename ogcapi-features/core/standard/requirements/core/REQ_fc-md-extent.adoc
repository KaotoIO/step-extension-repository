^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/core/fc-md-extent* 
^|A |For each feature collection, the `extent` property, if provided, SHALL provide bounding boxes that include all spatial geometries and time intervals that include all temporal geometries in this collection. The temporal extent with a `null` value at start or end indicates a half-bounded interval.
^|B |If a feature has multiple properties with spatial or temporal information, it is the decision of the server whether only a single spatial or temporal geometry property is used to determine the extent or all relevant geometries.
