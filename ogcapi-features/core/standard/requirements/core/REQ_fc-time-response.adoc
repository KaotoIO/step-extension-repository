^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/core/fc-time-response*
^|A |Only features that have a temporal geometry that intersects the temporal information in the `datetime` parameter SHALL be part of the result set, if the parameter is provided.
^|B |If a feature has multiple temporal properties, it is the decision of the server whether only a single temporal property is used to determine the extent or all relevant temporal properties.
^|C |The `datetime` parameter SHALL match all features in the collection that are not associated with a temporal geometry, too.
^|D |Temporal geometries are either a date-time value or a time interval. The parameter value SHALL conform to the following syntax (using link:https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2234.html[ABNF]):

```
interval-bounded            = date-time "/" date-time
interval-half-bounded-start = [".."] "/" date-time
interval-half-bounded-end   = date-time "/" [".."]
interval                    = interval-closed / interval-half-bounded-start / interval-half-bounded-end
datetime                    = date-time / interval
```
^|E |The syntax of `date-time` is specified by link:https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html#section-5.6[RFC 3339, 5.6].
^|F |Half-bounded time intervals are supported using a double-dot (`..`) or an empty string for the start/end.
