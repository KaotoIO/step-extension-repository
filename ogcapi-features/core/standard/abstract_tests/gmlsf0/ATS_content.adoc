^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/gmlsf0/content*
^|Test Purpose |Verify the content of an GML Simple Features 0 document given an input document and schema.
^|Requirement |<<req_gmlsf0_content,/req/gmlsf0/content>>, <<req_gmlsf0_headers,/req/gmlsf0/headers>>
^|Test Method |. For the resources "Features" and "Feature", validate that the document is a GML Simple Features level 0 document.
. Verify that the document has the expected root element.
. Validate the document against the schema using an XML schema validator.
. If the API supports the GeoJSON encoding, too, and the response to the same request, but with a different `Accept` header includes the properties `timeStamp`, `numberMatched`, `numberReturned` and/or links in the payload, verify that the same information is included as HTTP headers in the GML response.
. For a GML document that is the response of a GET request to a Feature resource, verify that the `gml:id` XML attribute of the GML feature element is identical to the `featureId` path parameter of the request.
