^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/core/fc-md-extent*
^|Test Purpose |Validate the `extent` property, if it is present
^|Requirement |<<req_core_fc-md-extent,/req/core/fc-md-extent>>
^|Test Method |. Verify that the `extent`, if present, provides bounding boxes that include all spatial geometries in this collection.
. Verify that the `extent`, if present, provides time intervals that include all temporal geometries in this collection. A temporal boundary of `null` at start or end indicates a half-bounded interval.
