^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/core/fc-bbox-response*
^|Test Purpose |Validate that the bounding box query parameters are processed correctly.
^|Requirement |<<req_core_fc-bbox-response,/req/core/fc-bbox-response>>
^|Test Method |. Verify that only features that have a spatial geometry that intersects the bounding box are returned as part of the result set.
. Verify that the `bbox` parameter matched all features in the collection that were not associated with a spatial geometry (this is only applicable for datasets that include features without a spatial geometry).
. Verify that the coordinate reference system of the geometries is WGS 84 longitude/latitude ("http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84" or "http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/CRS84h") since no parameter `bbox-crs` was specified in the request.
