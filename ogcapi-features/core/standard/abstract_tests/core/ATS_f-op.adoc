^|Test Purpose |Validate that a feature can be retrieved from the expected location.
^|Requirement |<<req_core_f-op,/req/core/f-op>>
^|Test Method |. For a sufficiently large subset of all features in a feature collection (path `/collections/{collectionId}`), issue an HTTP GET request to the URL `/collections/{collectionId}/items/{featureId}` where `{collectionId}` is the `id` property of the collection and `{featureId}` is the local identifier property of the feature (the representation in the feature content depends on the encoding).
. Validate that a feature was returned with a status code 200
. Validate the contents of the returned feature using test <<ats_core_f-success,/conf/core/f-success>>.
