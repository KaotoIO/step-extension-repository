^|Test Purpose |Validate that all spatial geometries provided through the API are in the CRS84 or CRS84h coordinate reference system unless otherwise requested by the client.
^|Requirement |<<req_core_crs84,/req/core/crs84>>
^|Test Method |. Do not specify a coordinate reference system in any request. All spatial data should be in the CRS84 or CRS84h reference system.
. Validate retrieved spatial data using the CRS84 reference system (for 2D geometries) or the CRS84h reference system (for 3D geometries).
