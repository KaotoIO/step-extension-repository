^|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |*/rec/core/fc-md-descriptions*
^|A |If external schemas or descriptions for the dataset exist that provide information about the structure or semantics of the data, a `200`-response SHOULD include links to each of those resources in the `links` property of the response (relation: `describedby`).
^|B |The `type` link parameter SHOULD be provided for each link. This applies to resources that describe the whole dataset. 
^|C |For resources that describe the contents of a feature collection, the links SHOULD be set in the `links` property of the appropriate object in the `collections` resource.
^|D |Examples for descriptions are: XML Schema, Schematron, JSON Schema, RDF Schema, OWL, SHACL, a feature catalogue, etc.
