^|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |*/rec/crs/crs-format-model* +
2+|Servers that implement this extension SHOULD be able to recognize and
generate CRS identifiers with the following format model:

`\http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/{authority}/{version}/{code}`

In this format model, the token `{authority}` is a placeholder for a value that
designates to authority responsible for the definition of this CRS.  Typical
values include "EPSG" and "OGC".

The token `{version}` is a placeholder for the specific version of the CRS definition or `0` for un-versioned CRS definitions.

The token `{code}` is a placeholder for the authority's code for the CRS.
