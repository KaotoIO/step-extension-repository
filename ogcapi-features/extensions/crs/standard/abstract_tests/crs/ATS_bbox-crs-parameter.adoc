^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/crs/bbox-crs-parameter*
^|Test Purpose |Verify that the parameter `bbox-crs` has been implemented correctly
^|Requirement |<<req_crs_fc-bbox-crs-definition,/req/crs/fc-bbox-crs-definition>>, <<req_crs_fc-bbox-crs-action,/req/crs/fc-bbox-crs-action>>
^|Test Method |For every CRS identifier advertized by the Web API that is known to the test engine and for which the test engine can convert geometries between the CRS and the default CRS of the Web API ("known CRS") execute the following test. Skip the test for unknown CRSs.

. For each spatial feature collection `collectionId` and every GML or GeoJSON feature representation supported by the Web API, send a request with the parameters `bbox` and `bbox-crs` to `/collections/{collectionId}/items` for every known CRS. Use a `bbox` value in the spatial extent of the collection, converted to the known CRS. Verify that all features intersect the bounding box of the request.
|===

NOTE: An earlier version of the test requested that the responses with different CRSs include the same features. However, an axis-aligned rectangle in one CRS may be a completely different shape in the other CRS, so the test can only verify that the request results are correct for each CRS.
