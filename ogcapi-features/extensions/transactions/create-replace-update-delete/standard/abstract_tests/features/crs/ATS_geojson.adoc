((If a server implements this standard and also implements the http://fix.me[Coordinate Reference Systems by Reference] extension and the request body contains a feature encoded using GeoJSON then the prior arrangements provision of the GeoJSON standard (see https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946.html#page-12) shall apply between the server and the client.))
((The feature in the request body shall thus be subject to requirement <<req_create-replace-delete_crs_storage-crs>>.))
