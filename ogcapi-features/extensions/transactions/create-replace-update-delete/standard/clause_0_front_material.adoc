[big]*i.     Abstract*

OGC API standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs in a consistent way. The <<OpenAPI,OpenAPI specification>> is used to define the API building blocks.

This document defines the behaviour of an API that allows resource instances 
to be added, replaced, modified and/or removed for a collection.

NOTE: This specification is being developed in the OGC Features API SWG but is being written as a generic extension that is applicable to a variety of resource types including features.  The feature-specific portions of this extension are issolated to the clause titled <<features,Features>>.  It is anticipated that the bulk of this extension will eventually be moved into 'OGC API - Common' and only the feature-specific content will remain to be managed by the OGC Features API SWG.

CAUTION: This is a DRAFT version of the 4th part of the OGC API - Features standards. This draft is not complete and there are open issues that are still under discussion.
