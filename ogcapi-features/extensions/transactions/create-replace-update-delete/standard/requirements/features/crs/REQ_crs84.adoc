^|Condition |Server does not implement <<OAFeat-2,OGC API - Features - Part 2: Coordinate Reference Systems by Reference>>
^|A |The server SHALL interpret all geometries in request bodies of requests to the resources or resource endpoints to be in the coordinate reference system http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84 (WGS 84 longitude/latitude) for geometries without height information and http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/CRS84h (WGS 84 longitude/latitude plus ellipsoidal height) for geometries with height information.
