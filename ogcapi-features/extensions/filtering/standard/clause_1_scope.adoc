== Scope

This document specifies an extension to the <<OAFeat-1,OGC API - Features -
Part 1: Core>> standard that defines the behavior of a server that supports
enhanced filtering capabilities expressed using the Common Query Language (CQL2).

Enhanced filtering capabilities in this case means that the server supports
the ability to define selection clauses using predicates beyond those supported
by Part 1 (i.e., `bbox` and `datetime`).

This document defines

* Query parameters for specifying a filter in a request to a Web API;
* Support for CQL2 Text and CQL2 JSON as languages for filter expressions;
* How the set of properties that can be used to construct filter expressions ("queryables") are published by a Web API.
