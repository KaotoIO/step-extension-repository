^|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |*/rec/filter/queryables-schema*
^|A |Each property SHOULD have a human readable title (`title`) and where
necessary a description (`description`).
^|B |Each property SHOULD have a single type (`type`) with one of the following
values: `string` (string or temporal properties), `number`/`integer` (numeric properties), 
`boolean` (boolean properties), `array` (array properties), or `object` (spatial properties).
^|C |For string properties, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `enum` and/or `pattern`
SHOULD be provided, where applicable.
^|D |For numeric properties, `multipleOf`, `minimum`, `exclusiveMinimum`,
`maximum`, `exclusiveMaximum` SHOULD be provided, where applicable.
^|E |For integer properties that represent enumerated values, `enum` SHOULD
be provided.
^|F |For temporal properties, the property SHOULD be a `string` literal with 
the appropriate format `date-time` or `date`, depending on the temporal granularity.
^|G |For spatial properties, the property SHOULD reference a well-known
JSON Schema of the geometry object.
^|H |For geometry types according to the Simple Features standard, the 
canonical JSON Schema of the GeoJSON geometry object SHOULD be referenced; 
for example, `https://geojson.org/schema/Point.json` for a point geometry.
^|I |For array properties, the property SHOULD consist of items that are strings
or numbers.
^|J |The `additionalProperties` member with a value of `true` or `false` SHOULD be used to control the behavior with respect to properties that are not explicitly declared in the queryables schema. If the member is missing or has the default value `true`, any property name is valid in a filter expression and the property reference will evaluate to `null`, if the property does not exist for a resource. If `additionalProperties` is set to `false`, property references that are not explicitly declared in the queryables schema will result in a `400` response.
