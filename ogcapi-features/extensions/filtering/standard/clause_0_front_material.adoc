[big]*i.     Abstract*

OGC API standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs in a consistent way. The <<OpenAPI,OpenAPI specification>> is used to define the API building blocks.

OGC API - Features provides API building blocks to create, modify and query
features on the Web. OGC API Features is comprised of multiple parts. Each
part is a separate standard.

A fundamental operation performed on a <<collection-def,collection>> of features is that of
filtering in order to obtain a subset of the data which contains feature
instances that satisfy some filtering criteria.  Part three of the OGC API - Feature Standard defines 
query parameters (`filter`, `filter-lang`, `filter-crs`) to specify filter
criteria in a request to an API.

CAUTION: This is a DRAFT version of the 3rd part of the OGC API - Features standards.
