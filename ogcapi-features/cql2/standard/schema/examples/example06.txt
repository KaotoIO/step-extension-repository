EXAMPLE: Fine scenes where the cloud cover is between 0.1 and 0.2 and the Landsat
         row is 28 and the Landsat path 203.

eo:cloud_cover BETWEEN 0.1 AND 0.2
   AND landsat:wrs_row=28
   AND landsat:wrs_path=203

ALTERNATIVE EXPRESSION: eo:cloud_cover >= 0.1 AND eo:cloud_cover <= 0.2
                           AND landsat:wrs_row=28
                           AND landsat:wrs_path=203
