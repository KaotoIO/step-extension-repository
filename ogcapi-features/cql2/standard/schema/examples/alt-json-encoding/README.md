This folder contains the CQL filter expression examples encoded using the [JSON encoding described in the current draft](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/19-079r1.html#cql2-json) but re-encodes them using an alternate, array-based, encoding described [here](https://github.com/tschaub/ogcapi-features/tree/json-array-expression/extensions/cql).

The intent is to evaluate the relative merits of the two, proposed, JSON encodings for CQL filter expressions.
