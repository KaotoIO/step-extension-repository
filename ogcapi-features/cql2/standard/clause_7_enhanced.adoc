[[case-insensitive-comparison]]
=== Requirements Class "Case-insensitive Comparison"

include::requirements/requirements_class_case-insensitive-comparison.adoc[]

The following requirements class adds support for case-insensitive string comparisons.

This capability is useful to operate across data that has not been normalized or has been normalized to values that are different than they should be. This is implemented via a string-valued operator to normalize a string with respect to case (`CASEI`). 

For example, the `CASEI` operator is useful when a property is set to "PLANET", "Planet", or "planet" and one wants to match either without having to enumerate all the variations.

Implementations of the `CASEI` operator can be complex and depend on the locale, but in many cases the underlying datastore will provide a capability that the operator can be mapped to.

include::requirements/case-insensitive-comparison/REQ_casei-operator.adoc[]

[[example_7_4_casei]]
.Example case-insensitive comparison
====

----
CASEI(road_class) IN (CASEI('Οδος'),CASEI('Straße'))
----

[source,JSON]
----
{
  "op": "in",
  "args": [
    { "casei": { "property": "road_class" } },
    [
      { "casei": "Οδος" },
      { "casei": "Straße"}
    ]
  ]
}
----
====

The `CASEI` operator returns a string typed representation of the input expression that is guaranteed to be equal to any other case insensitive representation of that string.  In order to ensure correct comparisons, these operator should be applied to both sides of an expression. So, for example, the only durable case-insensitive equality comparison would be `CASEI(some_property) = CASEI('Straße')`.  An expression such as `CASEI(some_property) = 'strasse'` might work but is not guaranteed to work across implementations or between versions of the same implementation.

[[accent-insensitive-comparison]]
=== Requirements Class "Accent-insensitive Comparison"

include::requirements/requirements_class_accent-insensitive-comparison.adoc[]

This requirements class adds support for accent-insensitive string comparisons to operate across data that has not been normalized or has been normalized to values that are different than they should be.

Similar to the case-insensitive comparison, this capability is supported via a string-valued operator `ACCENTI`. 

For example, the `ACCENTI` operator is useful when accents (or, more generally, diacritics not available in ASCII) were dropped when indexing a property. This may be useful, for example, to support users that are not familiar with accents or that do not know how to type them on their keyboard. For example, "papa" would also match "papá". Note that accent-insensitive comparisons can match values with a different meaning. E.g., in Spanish "papa" is potato and "papá" is father. "papá" in an accent-insensitive comparison will match both, but this may also be intentional, because the users knows that some of the data has been processed in ASCII.

Implementations of the `ACCENTI` operator can be complex, but in many cases the underlying datastore will provide a capability that the operator can be mapped to.

include::requirements/accent-insensitive-comparison/REQ_accenti-operator.adoc[]

[[example_7_4_accenti]]
.Example accent-insensitive comparison
====

----
ACCENTI(etat_vol) = ACCENTI('débárquér')

{
  "op": "=",
  "args": [
    { "accenti": { "property": "etat_vol" } },
    { "accenti": "débárquér" }
  ]
}
----
====

Like `CASEI`, the `ACCENTI` operator returns a string typed representation of the input expression that is guaranteed to be equal to any other accent insensitive representation of that string. In order to ensure correct comparisons, the operator should be applied to both sides of an expression.  So, for example, the only durable accent-insensitive equality comparison would be `ACCENTI(some_property) = ACCENTI('papá')`. An expression such as `ACCENTI(some_property) = 'papa'` might work but is not guaranteed to work across implementations or between versions of the same implementation.

[[basic-spatial-operators]]
=== Requirements Class "Basic Spatial Operators"

include::requirements/requirements_class_basic-spatial-operators.adoc[]

A _spatial predicate_ evaluates two geometry-valued expressions to determine if the expressions satisfy the requirements of the specified spatial operator.

==== Spatial data types and literal values

The spatial data types are (literal rule `spatialLiteral`): 

* "Point": a point;
* "MultiPoint": a collection of points;
* "LineString": a curve with linear interpolation between the vertices;
* "MultiLineString": a collection of line strings;
* "Polygon": a planar surface bounded by closed line strings;
* "MultiPolygon": a collection of polygons;
* "Geometry": an instance of "Point", "MultiPoint", "LineString", "MultiLineString", "Polygon", or "MultiPolygon";
* "GeometryCollection": a collection of "Geometry" instances.

Existing representations are used for literal values:

* Text: an https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=25355[OGC Well-Known Text (WKT)] literal
* JSON: a https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946.html#section-3.1[GeoJSON geometry] object

Since WKT and GeoJSON do not provide a capability to specify the CRS of a geometry literal, the server has to determine the CRS of the geometry literals in a filter expression through another mechanism. For example, a query parameter `filter-crs` is used in <<OGCFeat-3,OGC API - Features - Part 3: Filtering>> to pass the CRS information to the server.

[[temporal-operators]]
=== Requirements Class "Temporal Operators"

include::requirements/requirements_class_temporal-operators.adoc[]

A temporal predicate evaluates two time-valued expressions to determine, if the expressions satisfy the requirements of the specified temporal operator.

The operands in a temporal predicate are temporal geometries. A temporal geometry is either an instant or an interval.

==== Temporal data types and literal values

An instant is either a date (rule `dateInstant`) or a timestamp (rule `timestampInstant`) in accordance with <<rfc3339,RFC 3339>> (RFC 3339 rules `full-date` or `date-time`). Note that since time is continuous, every instant has a duration and a start/end. Nevertheless, the geometry can be considered an instant in the temporal resolution that is applicable for the specific property. 

An interval is the time between a start instant and an end instant, including both bounding instances (rule `intervalLiteral`). Unbounded interval ends are represented by a double-dot string ("..") based on the convention specified in ISO 8601-2.

CQL2 follows ISO 8601-1/ISO 8601-2 in defining intervals as closed at both start and end. Note that some implementations and other specifications use a different definition and it may be necessary to convert between the interval representations. For example, SQL uses half-closed intervals - closed at the start, open at the end.

Depending on the implementation environment, the underlying datastore may or may not support intervals as data types of properties. If not, intervals are typically represented by two separate properties that are instants, one for the start and one for the end of the interval.

All temporal geometries are in the Gregorian Calendar. This is a deliberate restriction to keep implementations of CQL2 simple, avoiding requirements to transform time instants to other temporal coordinate reference systems, but still cover a large number of use cases. This is consistent with the use of RFC 3339 as a key standard for expressing date and time on the internet, including in the OGC API standards.

For intervals, the following representations are used:

* Text: an `INTERVAL` operator with two instants or double-dot strings as parameters;
* JSON: an object with an `interval` member with an array of two instants or double-dot strings as parameters.

In case two instants are provided, both instants have the same granularity (i.e., they are either timestamps or dates).

NOTE: Instants are also scalar data types; for the representations and examples of instances see <<scalar-data-types>>.

==== Temporal Operators 

The temporal operators in CQL2 are based on the definitions in the <<owl-time,W3C/OGC Time Ontology in OWL>>. 

NOTE: <<per_basic-cql2_time-instant-comparison,Simple temporal predicates>> involving time instants can also be evaluated using the <<basic-cql2_comparison-predicates,standard comparison operators>>.

The following table specifies the definition of the temporal operators where both operands may be instants or intervals, including mixed combinations.

==== Type casts

As stated in <<type-casts>>, the evaluation of filter expressions that involve type casts is system dependent.

For example, a system that evaluates the interval `INTERVAL('2022-01-01','2022-04-11T12:41:13Z')` can, for example,

* throw an error (incompatible types in an interval);
* cast the value to an interval of dates, e.g., `INTERVAL('2022-01-01','2022-04-11')`;
* cast the value to an interval of timestamps, e.g., `INTERVAL('2022-01-01Z00:00:00Z','2022-04-11T12:41:13Z')`.

is a subset of another, if one array is a superset of another or if two
arrays overlap or share elements.

include::requirements/array-operators/REQ_array-predicates.adoc[]

include::recommendations/array-operators/PER_array-predicates.adoc[]

NOTE: Support for the BNF rule `function` is added by
the requirements class <<rc_functions,Functions>>.
Support for the BNF rule `arithmeticExpression` is added by
the requirements class <<rc_arithmetic,Arithmetic Expressions>>.

[[functions]]
=== Requirements Class "Functions"

include::requirements/requirements_class_functions.adoc[]

This sub-clause specifies requirements for supporting functions in CQL2. Functions
allow implementations to extend the language.

include::requirements/functions/REQ_functions.adoc[]

NOTE: Support for the BNF rule `arithmeticExpression` is added by
the requirements class <<rc_arithmetic,Arithmetic Expressions>>.

[[example_7_13]]

It should be noted that the function "Buffer()" in this example is not part of CQL2 but is an example of a function that an implementation may offer that returns a geometry value.

[[arithmetic]]
=== Requirements Class "Arithmetic Expressions"

include::requirements/requirements_class_arithmetic.adoc[]

This clause specifies requirements for supporting arithmetic expressions in CQL2.
An arithmetic expression is an expression composed of an arithmetic operand
(a property name, a number or a function that returns a number), an arithmetic
operator (i.e., one of `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `div`, or `^`) and another arithmetic operand.

`+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` are the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). In addition, the modulo operator (`%`), integer division (`div`), and the exponention operator (`^`) are supported.

include::requirements/arithmetic/REQ_arithmetic.adoc[]

NOTE: Support for the BNF rule `function` is added by the requirements class <<rc_functions,Functions>>.
