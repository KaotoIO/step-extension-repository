[cols=">20h,<80a",width="100%"]
|===
|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | <<req_{conf-class}_array-predicates,/req/{conf-class}/array-predicates>>
|Test purpose: | Test the array operators
|Test method: | 
Given:

* One of more data sources each with a list of queryables.
* At least one queryable has an array data type.

When:

For each queryable `{queryable}` with an array data type, evaluate the following filter expressions

* `A_CONTAINS({queryable},["foo","bar"])`
* `A_CONTAINEDBY({queryable},["foo","bar"])`
* `A_EQUALS({queryable},["foo","bar"])`
* `A_OVERLAPS({queryable},["foo","bar"])`

Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation;
* store the valid predicates for each data source.

:conf-test: logical
==== Conformance Test {counter:test-id}
[cols=">20h,<80a",width="100%"]
|===
|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | n/a
|Test purpose: | Test filter expressions with AND, OR and NOT including sub-expressions
|Test method: | 
Given:

* The stored predicates for each data source, including from the dependencies.

When:

For each data source, select at least 10 random combinations of four predicates (`{p1}` to `{p4}`) from the stored predicates and evaluate the filter expression `\((NOT {p1} AND {p2}) OR ({p3} and NOT {p4}) or not ({p1} AND {p4}))`.

Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation.
