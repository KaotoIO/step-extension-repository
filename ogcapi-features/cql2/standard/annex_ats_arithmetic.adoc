|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | <<req_{conf-class}_arithmetic,/req/{conf-class}/arithmetic>>
|Test purpose: | Test predicates with arithmetic expressions
|Test method: | 
Given:

* One of more data sources each with a list of queryables.
* At least one queryable has a numeric data type.

When:

* For each queryable construct multiple valid filter expressions involving arithmetic expressions.

Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation.

|Requirements: | all requirements
|Test purpose: | Test predicates against the test dataset
|Test method: | 
Given:

* The implementation under test uses the test dataset.

When:

Evaluate each predicate in <<test-data-predicates-arithmetic>>, if the conditional dependency is met.

Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation;
* assert that the expected result is returned;
* store the valid predicates for each data source.

|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | n/a
|Test purpose: | Test filter expressions with AND, OR and NOT including sub-expressions
|Test method: | 
Given:

* The stored predicates for each data source, including from the dependencies.

When:

For each data source, select at least 10 random combinations of four predicates (`{p1}` to `{p4}`) from the stored predicates and evaluate the filter expression `\((NOT {p1} AND {p2}) OR ({p3} and NOT {p4}) or not ({p1} AND {p4}))`.

Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation.
