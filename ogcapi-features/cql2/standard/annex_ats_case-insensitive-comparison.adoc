|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | <<req_{conf-class}_casei-operator,/req/{conf-class}/casei-operator>>
|Test purpose: | Test the CASEI operator in comparisons
|Test method: | 
Given:

* One of more data sources each with a list of queryables.

When:

For each queryable `{queryable}` of type String, evaluate the following filter expressions

* `CASEI({queryable}) = casei('foo')`
* `CASEI({queryable}) <> casei('FOO')`

Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation;
* assert that the two result sets for each queryable have no item in common;
* store the valid predicates for each data source.

|Test method: | 
Given:

* One of more data sources each with a list of queryables.
* The conformance class <<conf_advanced-comparison-operators,Advanced Comparison Operators>> passes.

When:

For each queryable `{queryable}` of type String, evaluate the following filter expressions

* `CASEI({queryable}) LIKE casei('foo%')`
* `CASEI({queryable}) LIKE casei('FOO%')`

Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation;
* assert that the two result sets for each queryable are identical;
* store the valid predicates for each data source.

|Test method: | 
Given:

* The implementation under test uses the test dataset.

When:

Evaluate each predicate in <<test-data-predicates-casei-operator>>, if the conditional dependency is met.

Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation;
* assert that the expected result is returned;
* store the valid predicates for each data source.

==== Conformance Test {counter:test-id}
[cols=">20h,<80a",width="100%"]
|===
|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | n/a
|Test purpose: | Test filter expressions with AND, OR and NOT including sub-expressions
|Test method: | 
Given:

* The stored predicates for each data source, including from the dependencies.

When:

For each data source, select at least 10 random combinations of four predicates (`{p1}` to `{p4}`) from the stored predicates and evaluate the filter expression `\((NOT {p1} AND {p2}) OR ({p3} and NOT {p4}) or not ({p1} AND {p4}))`.

Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation.
