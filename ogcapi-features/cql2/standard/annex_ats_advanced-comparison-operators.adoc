|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | <<req_{conf-class}_like-predicate,/req/{conf-class}/like-predicate>>
|Test purpose: | Test LIKE predicate
|Test method: | 
Given:

* One of more data sources each with a list of queryables.

When:

For each queryable `{queryable}` of type String, evaluate the following filter expressions

* `{queryable} LIKE '%'`
* `{queryable} like '_%'`
* `{queryable} like ''`
* `{queryable} like '%%'`
* `{queryable} like '\\%\\_'`


Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation;
* assert that the two result sets for each queryable for the pattern expression `'_%'` and `''` have no item in common;
* assert that the two result sets for each queryable for the pattern expression `'%'` and `'%%'` are identical;
* store the valid predicates for each data source.

|Test method: | 
Given:

* One of more data sources each with a list of queryables.

When:

for each queryable `{queryable}` of type Number or Integer, evaluate the following filter expressions

* `{queryable} BETWEEN 0 AND 100`
* `{queryable} between 100.0 and 1.0`

Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation;

|Test method: | 
Given:

* One of more data sources each with a list of queryables.

When:

* for each queryable `{queryable}` of type Number or Integer, evaluate the following filter expression `{queryable} IN (1, 2, 3)`;
* for each queryable `{queryable}` of type String, evaluate the following filter expression `{queryable} in ('foo', 'bar')`;
* for each queryable `{queryable}` of type Boolean, evaluate the following filter expression `{queryable} in (true)`;
* for each queryable `{queryable}` of type Timestamp, evaluate the following filter expression `{queryable} in ('2022-04-14T14:52:56Z', '2022-04-14T15:52:56Z')`;
* for each queryable `{queryable}` of type Date, evaluate the following filter expression `{queryable} in ('2022-04-14', '2022-04-15')`;

Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation;
* store the valid predicates for each data source.

|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | n/a
|Test purpose: | Test filter expressions with AND, OR and NOT including sub-expressions
|Test method: | 
Given:

* The stored predicates for each data source, including from the dependencies.

When:

For each data source, select at least 10 random combinations of four predicates (`{p1}` to `{p4}`) from the stored predicates and evaluate the filter expression `\((NOT {p1} AND {p2}) OR ({p3} and NOT {p4}) or not ({p1} AND {p4}))`.

Then:

* assert successful execution of the evaluation.
