=== Introduction

NOTE: This needs to be updated.

OGC API Features is not a Web Service in the traditional sense. Rather, it defines the behavior and content of a set of Resources exposed through a Web Application Programing Interface (Web API). Therefore, an API may expose resources in addition to those defined by the standard. A test engine must be able to traverse the API, identify and validate test points, and ignore resource paths which are not to be tested.
