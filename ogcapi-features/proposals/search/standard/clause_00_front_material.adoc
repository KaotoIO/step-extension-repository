[big]*i.     Abstract*

NOTE: This is a PROPOSAL DRAFT for a search extension to OGC API Features.  As such it is INCOMPLETE.

OGC API standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs in a consistent way. The <<OpenAPI,OpenAPI specification>> is used to define the API building blocks.

This extension defines the behaviour of an API that supports search capabilities
beyond those defined in Part 1 and which may include query expressions that are not conveniently encoded as query parameters on a URL as defined in Part 3.

NOTE: This specification is being developed in the OGC API - Features SWG but is being written as a generic extension that is applicable to a variety of resource types including features.  The feature-specific portions of this extension are issolated to the clause titled <<features,Features>>.  It is anticipated that the bulk of this extension will eventually be moved into 'OGC API - Common' and only the feature-specific content will remain to be managed by the 'OGC API - Features' SWG.

CAUTION: This is a DRAFT version of the 5th part of the OGC API - Features standards. This draft is not complete and there are open issues that are still under discussion.
