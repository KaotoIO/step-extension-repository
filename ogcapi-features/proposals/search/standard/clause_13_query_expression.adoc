=== Query Expressions

include::requirements/ogc-json-query-expression/REQ_schema.adoc[]

include::requirements/ogc-json-query-expression/REQ_crs.adoc[]

NOTE: Need to define what join output looks like ... i.e. tuples.

=== Examples

[[example_13_1]]
.Query a single collection.

[[example_13_3]]
.Example of a spatial join query.
====
Find all the lakes in Algonquin Park.  The query object contains a 
"collections" key which is the list of collections being queries.
The "filter" key is simply CQL.

The response is an array of "tuples".  That is, pairs (since we are 
querying two collections) of features that satisfy the query predicates.
Since the "parks" feature in each tuple would always be the same (i.e.
Algonquin Park) we use a JSON reference in every tuple after the first
one to reference the Algoquin Park feature rather than duplicating it
over and over.

The features themselves are encoded as GeoJSON.
