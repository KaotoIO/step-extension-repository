This page shows how to connect with OWSLib to an API that implements OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core.

## Links

- [OWSLib OGC API Features documentation](http://geopython.github.io/OWSLib/#ogc-api-features-1-0)

## Software version

This description uses OWSLib 0.23.0.

## Required and supported Conformance classes

The API must support the [Core](http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-1/1.0/conf/core), [GeoJSON](http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-1/1.0/conf/geojson) and [OpenAPI 3.0](http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-features-1/1.0/conf/oas3) conformance classes.

The CRS conformance class from Part 2 (Coordinate Reference Systems by Reference) is not supported.

## Examples

The `OGCAPIFeaturesWithOWSLib.ipynb` Jupyter notebook on [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ghobona/notebooks/main) has multiple steps to read and navigate in Python through an API. To create a copy of the notebook, click on `OGCAPIFeaturesWithOWSLib.ipynb`. 

Press `Run` to execute the selected step of the notebook. Python code in steps can be edited.

For more information on Jupyter notebooks, see [jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org/).
