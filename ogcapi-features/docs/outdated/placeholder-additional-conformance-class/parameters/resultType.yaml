description: >-
  This service will respond to a query in one of two ways (excluding
  an exception response). It may either generate a complete
  response document containing resources that satisfy the
  operation or it may simply generate an empty response container
  that indicates the count of the total number of resources that the
  operation would return. Which of these two responses is generated is
  determined by the value of the optional resultType parameter.\

  The allowed values for this parameter are "results" and "hits".\

  If the value of the resultType parameter is set to "results", the server
  will generate a complete response document containing resources that
  satisfy the operation.\

  If the value of the resultType attribute is set to "hits", the server
  will generate an empty response document containing no resource
  instances.\

  Default = "results".
